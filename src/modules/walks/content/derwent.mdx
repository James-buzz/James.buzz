Starting from Fairholmes car park, this walk takes you

This hike around the Ladybower Reservoir is great because it allows you to see a variety of Peak District habitats.

Traveling through farms and up steep wooded cloughs, you will finally reach the moors' peak. From this vantage point, you can see all the way over the Dark Peak region and the Derwent Valley.

As you go around, keep your eyes out for native animals and take in the scenery. As you make your way over a variety of farms and moorland, keep an eye out for some of the region's most striking species, such as big mountain hares (with white coats in winter) and golden plovers.

The Fairholmes parking lot is the starting and ending point of the trek between Derwent and Ladybower Reservoirs.
