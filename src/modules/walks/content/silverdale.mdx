One might miss Silverdale on the way to the Lake District, and that would be a real shame. Silverdale features breathtaking landscapes from ancient woodlands, sparkling sands to quaint villages. It is also home to the Leighton Moss RSPB Nature Reserve, a mecca for bird watchers from across the country.
