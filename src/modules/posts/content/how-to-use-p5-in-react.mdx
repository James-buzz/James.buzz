<a href={"https://p5js.org/"}>p5.js</a> is a Javascript package that makes it easy to create visual graphics in
the browser.
These visuals are created by p5.js using the html <CodeBlock>&#60;canvas&#62;</CodeBlock> element.

The HTML <CodeBlock>&#60;canvas&#62;</CodeBlock> element is used to draw graphics in javascript on the fly.
The <CodeBlock>&#60;canvas&#62;</CodeBlock> element is simply a container for graphics.
To create the graphics on canvas, you can utilise Javascript.
You must use Javascript to actually draw the graphics.
Canvas includes a variety of tools for creating paths, boxes, circles, text, and images.

Here is an example of what you can do with Canvas using ball physics:

### How to install
You need to install these libraries to integrate p5.js into react

```text
npm i --save p5 react-p5
```




### The code
Now we are ready to write some code.

We will start by creating a new React component that will render the react-p5 Sketch component.
The Sketch component will handle the canvas and allow you to input your p5.js sketches.

```tsx
import Sketch from "react-p5";
import p5Types from "p5";

const p5Component = () => {
    const setup = (p5: p5Types, canvasRef: any) => {
        // Setup Canvas here
    }
    const draw = (p5: p5Types) => {
        // Draw HTML5 Canvas here
    }
    return <Sketch setup={setup} draw={draw} />
}

export default p5Component;
```


You can use the <a href={"https://editor.p5js.org/"}>p5.js editor</a> online to create your graphic sketches beforehand and then integrate them into this React component.

You can see examples of p5.js sketches at <a href={"https://p5js.org/examples/"}>p5js.org/examples/</a>


### Setting up
Here we will set up the canvas with the width of 500px and 400px. We will also include drawing two eclipses and an orange background.


```tsx
import Sketch from "react-p5";
import p5Types from "p5";

const p5Component = () => {
    const setup = (p5: p5Types, canvasRef: any) => {
        p5.createCanvas(500, 400).parent(canvasRef);
    }
    const draw = (p5: p5Types) => {
        p5.background(255, 130, 20)
        p5.ellipse(100, 100, 100)
        p5.ellipse(300, 100, 100)
    }
    return <Sketch setup={setup} draw={draw} />
}

export default p5Component;
```


You can include the width and height of the canvas as Props

```tsx
import Sketch from "react-p5";
import p5Types from "p5";

interface Props {
    width: number;
    height: number;
}

const p5Component = ({width, height}: Props) => {
    const setup = (p5: p5Types, canvasRef: any) => {
        p5.createCanvas(width, height).parent(canvasRef);
    }
    const draw = (p5: p5Types) => {
        p5.background(255, 130, 20)
        p5.ellipse(100, 100, 100)
        p5.ellipse(300, 100, 100)
    }
    return <Sketch setup={setup} draw={draw}/>
}

export default p5Component;
```



### The result
The following is the html canvas output of the code above.
<ExampleP5 width={500} height={400}/>
