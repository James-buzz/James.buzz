In the 1980s,
<a href={"https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/"}>Craig Reynolds</a> developed a flocking model that simulates the approximate behaviours of birds,
fish, or whatever might make entities move and flock to one another.

Flocking is made up of three simple forces,
that when combined, cause the entities to flock like birds.

1. Alignment: Keep in the same direction as your neighbors.
2. Separation: Don’t get too close to your neighbors.
3. Cohesion: Stay near your neighbors.


### Alignment
Alignment is the tendency to move in the same direction as a group.
For example, when you walk down stairs with a group of friends,
you tend to move down the stairs together.
This is because the force of alignment keeps your body and limbs moving in sync with those around you so that
there’s no friction between them.

In flocking simulation, alignment refers to how closely birds are packed together—the closer they get, the more
likely they will collide with each other. The greater their density, or “clutter factor” (CF), the more it becomes harder for
them to avoid crashing into each other due to their proximity and their inability—or unwillingness—to turn around
quickly enough when needed

### Separation
The separation force is a repulsive force that keeps the birds from getting too close to each other. In this
example, it’s proportional to the distance between the birds and inversely proportional to the square of that
distance.

### Cohesion
In Flocking, you need to stay near your neighbors. This means that you should not be too far away from them and also
that they shouldn't be too close. Cohesion is the tendency of a group to move as a whole entity, rather than
individual objects or animals moving separately in random directions.

For example: If we have three birds flying around in a flock, then there are two types of cohesion between these
bodies:
- Physical/physical attraction – Birds will fly toward each other due to their physical properties (like feathers).
- Social/social attraction – Birds will fly toward others based on their social status or relationship with other members of the flock (if one bird is dominant over another).

## The result
The result of combining all three forces: Alignment, Separation, and Cohesion is a flocking simulation that approximates the behaviours of birds, fish, or any other organism that moves and flocks to one another.
